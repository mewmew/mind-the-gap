% Add P-consciousness by synthesis:
% "Make sure the vision system was susceptible to complementary colour after-images."

% "There is a representational state caused in the way its counterpart in us, and it is the source/cause of the conviction or judgement that there's a red stripe."

% Humes 'strange inversion'
% We mis-interpret an inner reaction as an outer cuase. We project it into the (manifest) world.

% "Uphill analysis, downhill synthesis."
%
%    Uphill analysis (reverse engineer it into its parts), downhil synthesis (synthesis out of parts; forward engineering by adding parts).
