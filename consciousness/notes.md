# Consciousness

Popper (1977):

> I share with materialists ... the evolutionary hypothesis ... evolution produces minds, and human language ... human minds produce stories, ..., works of art and science. All this, so it seems, has evolved without any violation of the laws of physics ... We can only wonder that the matter can thus transcend itself, by producing mind, purpose, and a world of the products of the human mind.
